Software: Python 3.7, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, SMOTE, SMOTEENN, RandomOverSampler, ClusterCentroids, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, EasyEnsembleClassifier

## Purpose 
Use statistical reasoning and machine learning in order to evaluate credit card risk. The data will come from a credit card dataset from the lending services company, LendingClub. After evaluating this data sample, two different machine learning models will be compared to reduce any bias that may occur when predicting credit risk.  

## Results 

### Deliverable 1 - Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
Three machine learning models, RandomOverSamples, SMOTE algorithms, and ClusterCentroids, have been used to evaluate which is better at predicting credit risk. The criteria used for this determination includes balanced accuracy scores, logistic regression classifiers, and classification reports. The resuls for all three can be found below. 

#### RandomOverSampler - Oversampling

### Deliverable 2 - SMOTEENN Algorithms to Predict Credit Risk

SMOTEENN algorithms will be used with an over- and under- sampling approach to determine if the results from combinatorial approaches are better at predicting credit risk over the resampling algorithms attempted in deliverable one.

## Summary
-Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
-There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification
